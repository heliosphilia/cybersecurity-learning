# Firewall Evasion (Trốn tường lửa)
Using some techniques: NULL, FIN, Xmas. However, there is another common firewall configuration we need to know how to bypass.

Your typical Windows host.

With its default firewall, block all ICMP packets. Problem: not only we often use ping to manually establish the activity of a target; Nmap does the same thing by default. 
This mean that: Nmap will register a host with this firewall as dead and not bother scanning it at all.

Solving: **-Pn**, which tells Nmap to not bother pinging the host before scanning it. This means that Nmap will always treat the target host as being alive, effective bypassing the ICMP block => takes a lot of time.

There are variety of ther switches whch Nmap considers useful for firewall evasion.
