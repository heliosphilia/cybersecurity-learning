# Overview
It can be used to do variety of things: from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits (khai thác) for them. The NSE is particularly useful for reconnaisance.

Some useful categories include:
- safe: won't affect the target
- intrusive (xâm phạm): not safe
- vuln: scan for vulnerabilities
- exploit: attempt (nỗ lực) to exploit a vulnerability
- auth: attempt to bypass authentication for running services
- brute: attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
- discovery: attempt to query running services for further information about the network

Using: nmap '--script-help <script-name>' for more information

### Basic Syntax
--script=<switch>
  Ex: --script=safe
      --script=vul
      --

--script=<script-name, script name> : to run a specific script
  Ex: --script=http-fileupload-exploiter
      --script=smb-enum-users,smb-enum-shares

--script=<script-name>.<arguments> : the argument connected to the corresponding

Some script require arguments (đối số), example, credentals, if they're exploiting authenticated vulnerability. 

nmap -p 80 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dav/shell.php',http-put.file='./shell.php'

>> http-put script, used to upload file using the PUT method. this takes 2 arguments: the url to upload the file, the file's location on disk.

### Searching for scripts
Two options for this:

1. The page on the Nmap website: [nmap-website](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/)

2. The local storage on your Linux at **/usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db**
- You can use **grep** through it to look for scripts. Ex: grep "fpt" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db
- Or using **ls** command. Ex: ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*dấu sao*fpt*dấu sao*

___
**Installing New Scripts**
If a script is missing in the **scripts** directory locaaly. 

You can fix this by: 'sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap'

Or using wget (search for syntax)
