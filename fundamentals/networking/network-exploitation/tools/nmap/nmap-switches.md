# Scan Types
There are 3 basic scan types:
- TCP connect scans (-sT)
- SYN "Half-open" scans (-sS)
- UDP scans (-sU)

There are several less common port scan types:
- TCP null scans (-sN)
- TCP FIN scans (-sF)
- TCP xmas scans (-sX)

### TCP Connect Scans (-sT)
TCP connect scan works by performing the three-way handshake with each target port in turn. Nmap tries to connect to each specified TCP port, and determines whether the services is open by the respone it receives.

* If the port is open: SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK

* If the port is closed: SYN -> RST (reset)

* But if the port is hidden behind a firewall: Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. Many firewalls are configured to simply *drop* incoming packets. The port is considered to be *filtered*.

But it's very easy to configure a firewall to respond with a RST TCP packet. This can make it extremely difficult to get an accurate reading of the target (if not possible).

___

### SYN Scans (-sS)
As with TCP scans, but SYN scan works sightly different. SYN scan are sometimes reffered to as "half-open" or "stealth" scans.

When TCP scan perform a full three-way handshaking, SYN scan sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server. Preventing the server from repeatedly trying to make the request. 

Adventages:
- Bypassing other Intrusion Detection system
- Often not logged by applications listening on open ports.
- Faster - don't need to bother about completing the three-way hanshaking.

Disadventages:
- Require sudo permissions.
- Unstable services are sometimes brought down by the SYN scans. So problematic if the client provided a production enviroment for the test.

It all depends sudo permissions, you can choose TCP or SYN scan. The exact same rules as with TCP connect.

___

### UDP Scans (-sU)
UDP connections are stateless. UDP connections rely on sending packets to a target port and hoping that they make it. So the lack of acknowledgement makes UDP more difficult to scan -> much slower.

* If the port is open: there should not be response. Nmap refers to the port as being **open|filtered**. But it could be firewall.
If it gets a UDP respone (unusual) => marked as *open*.
Commonly no respone, sent a second time as a double-check. Still no respone => marked **opne|filtered**

* If the port is close: the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet cotaining a message that port is unreachable.

- **Basic syntax:** nmap -sU --top-ports 20 *target* : scan the top 20 most commonly used UDP ports
=> Saving time, because UDP is hard to indentify whether a UDP connect actually is open.
