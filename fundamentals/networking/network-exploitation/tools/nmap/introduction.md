# Nmap

We BEGIN any attack with A PORT SCAN.
So why????
____

So to begin a security audit, we've been given one or multiple IP. And we need to get an idea of the "landscape" we are attacking - we need to establish which services are running on the targets. 
Ex: One is running a webserver, another is acting as a windows active directory domain controller.

The first stage in establishing this "map" is port scanning. Ports are necessary for making multiple network requests or having multiple services available. 
Ex: you want to load several webpages at once in a web browser, the program will establish connections to the remote webservers using different ports on your local machine.

Network connections are made between 2 ports - an open port listening on the server and a randomly selected port on your own computer. 

![port-example](https://i.imgur.com/3XAfRpI.png)

Every computer has 65535 available ports. But many of these are registered as standard ports. 
- HTTP: port 80
- HTTPS: port 443
- SMB port 445
But in CTF, standard ports can be altered (bị thay đổi)

If you don't know which of these ports a server has open, we can't attacking the target.
___

So why nmap???
_ Can be perform many different kinds of port scan
_ Look at enumerating which services are runnong on each port
_ Its scripting engine can be used to scan for vulnerablities
