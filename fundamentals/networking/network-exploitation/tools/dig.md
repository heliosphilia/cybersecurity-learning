# dig

- Allows us to manually query recursive DNS servers of our choice for information about domains.
- It's a very useful tool for network troubleshooting

### Basic Syntax:
- dig *domain* @*dns-server-ip*
  
  'dig google.com @1.1.1.1'
  
### Usage Options:
- dig google.com @1.1.1.1'
  > Focus the **ANSWER** section: TTL is in the second column
  
  > TTL (time to live): tells your computer when to stop considering the records as being valid - request the data again, rather than relying on the cached copy. It's measured in *seconds*. Ex: TTL = 175 = it will expired in 2 minutes and thirty-seven seconds
