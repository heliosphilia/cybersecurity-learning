# Enumerating SMB

**Enumeration**
Is the process of gathering information on a target to find potential attack vectors and aid in (hỗ trợ) exploitation.

Enumeration can be used to gather usernames, passwords, network information, hostnames,... or any other information that may be valuable to an attacker.

**SMB**
SMB share drives on a server that can be connected to and used to view or transfer files. SMB can ofter be a great starting point for an attacker looking to discover sensitive information.

**Port Scanning**
The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, applications, structure and os of the targer machine.

**Enum4Linux**
Is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems. 

*Syntax:* enum4linux [options]ip
*Some useful function:*
-U : get userlist
-M : get machine list
-S : get sharelist
-P : get password policy information
-G : get group and member list
-a : all of above
