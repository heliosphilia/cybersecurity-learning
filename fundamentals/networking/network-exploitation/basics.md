# The OSI Model: Overview
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a standardised model which we you to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking. It's actually the moew compact TCP/IP model.

Take a look:
**Layer 7. Application**
Providing networking options to programs running on a computer. It works almost exclusively with applications, providing an interface for them to use in order to transmit data.
Consists of: Client & Server


**Layer 6. Presentation**
Ensure that the date from the sending computer is displayed the same with the receiving computer.

Sending (ASCII) _transition_ Receiving (EBCDIC) _data compression_ _encryption_

**Layer 5. Session**
Set up a connection with the other computer accross the network. If a session can be established, layer 5 will maintain it, as well as co-operarte with the session layer of the remote computer in order to synchronise communications.
- Authentication: xác thực
- Authrixation: kiểm tra quyền truy cập vào vị trí nào (thư mục, data)

**Layer 4. Transport** *end-to-end* *segment/datagram*
- Choose the protocol over with the data is to be transmitted: TCP and UDP.
  + TCP - *connection-based*: A connection between the computers is established and maintained for the duration of the request. Reliable transmission, *all* packages get to the right place.
  + UDP: packets of data are essentially thrown at the receiving computer. Speed is more important.

- Gồm các công việc:
  + Segmentation: divides and packs data into the packet (segment/datagram).
  + Flow control: điều khiển luồn data từ gửi -> nhận, tránh tràn ngập data.
  + Error Control: phát hiện lỗi.

- Gồm 3 nghi thức:
  + Connection: hướng kết nối, tạo kết nối trước khi gửi
  + Connectionless: hướng k kết nối.

**Layer 3. Network** *host-to-host* - *segment*
 - Path determination: Taking the IP address and figures out the best route to take.
 - Chức năng: Routing

**Layer 2. Data Link** *link-to-link* *frame*
Focuses on the *physical* addressing - MAC. MAC address is on the NIC and can't be changed, but it can be *spoofed*.
- Error Detection: make sure that it hasn't been corrupted during transmission.

**Layer 1. Physical** 
Convert the BITs (binary data) into the signals and transmit them accross the network.
Ex: cáp quang -> ánh sáng, dây đồng -> điện, air -> vô tuyến.
